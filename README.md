This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML involving a simple typo in accessing a DOM element. The incorrect function name `getElementByIdx` instead of `getElementById` leads to a runtime error in the browser's JavaScript console. The solution provides the correct way to access the element using the standard `getElementById` method. This showcases the importance of careful coding practices, even in seemingly simple tasks.
